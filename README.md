# DealGraph: a CRM built on a graph database

A proof-of-concept CRM whose data lives in Neo4j, with KPI analytics, a per-client monthly
conversion forecast (with back-test) and a recommendation engine that routes every new deal
to the best available sales person, using their own domain track record or that of similar
reps, and explains why. React UI served by FastAPI. Everything runs natively on Windows:
Neo4j as a local server process and the API with `uvicorn`. No Docker.

```
.
├── api/        FastAPI backend (Python): app/, tests/, scripts/, config.yaml, .env.example
├── ui/         React + TypeScript web UI (built into ui/dist, served by the API)
└── scripts/    PowerShell helpers: start.ps1, reset.ps1, test.ps1
```

> Proof of concept: there is no authentication. Anyone who can reach the API can reset the
> data (`POST /api/admin/seed`). Run it on your own machine only.

## Prerequisites (Windows 11, PowerShell)
- **Java 21** (Neo4j 5.26 runs on Java 17 or 21): `winget install EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.21.JDK`,
  then open a new terminal and check `java -version`.
- **Neo4j Community 5.26.31, Windows ZIP** (`neo4j-community-5.26.31-windows.zip`) from the
  [Neo4j Deployment Center](https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/) (Community → 5.26 LTS → Windows).
  Not the `.rpm`/`.deb` files and not the 2026.x line.
- **Python 3.12**, **Git**, and **Node.js 22+** (built and tested with Node 24 LTS) for the UI.

## Neo4j setup (once)
You run **two** Neo4j instances from two copies of the same ZIP:

| Instance | Folder | Bolt | Browser | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| dev | `C:\neo4j\dev` | 7687 | http://localhost:7474 | the API |
| test | `C:\neo4j\test` | 7688 | http://localhost:7475 | `pytest` only (tests wipe it) |

1. Extract the ZIP twice, so that `C:\neo4j\dev\bin\neo4j.bat` and `C:\neo4j\test\bin\neo4j.bat` exist.
2. In **each** folder, install the plugins:
   - APOC: copy `labs\apoc-5.26.31-core.jar` to `plugins\`.
   - GDS: the Windows ZIP does **not** include it. Download **GDS 2.13.13** (the version matched
     to Neo4j 5.26.31) once and copy it into `plugins\`:
     ```powershell
     $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
     Invoke-WebRequest https://graphdatascience.ninja/neo4j-graph-data-science-2.13.13.jar -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\neo4j-graph-data-science-2.13.13.jar"
     ```
3. In **each** folder, append to `conf\neo4j.conf`:
   ```
   dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=apoc.*,gds.*
   dbms.security.procedures.allowlist=apoc.*,gds.*
   server.memory.heap.initial_size=1G
   server.memory.heap.max_size=1G
   server.memory.pagecache.size=512M
   ```
   And in the **test** folder only, also append:
   ```
   server.bolt.listen_address=:7688
   server.http.listen_address=:7475
   ```
4. Create the API config and set the same password (at least 8 characters) on both instances
   **before their first start**:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item api\.env.example api\.env     # then edit NEO4J_PASSWORD in api\.env
   $pw = ((Get-Content api\.env | Where-Object { $_ -like 'NEO4J_PASSWORD=*' }) -split '=',2)[1]
   & C:\neo4j\dev\bin\neo4j-admin.bat dbms set-initial-password $pw
   & C:\neo4j\test\bin\neo4j-admin.bat dbms set-initial-password $pw
   ```

## Run locally
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - dev Neo4j (leave running; Ctrl+C stops it). Ready when it logs "Started."
C:\neo4j\dev\bin\neo4j.bat console

# Terminal 2 - API
cd api
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000 --no-access-log
```

If Neo4j is not up yet, the API waits up to 30 s, then starts anyway. `/api/health` reports
`degraded` until Neo4j is reachable and recovers by itself (no API restart needed).

## Web UI
Build it once (and after UI changes); the API then serves it at http://localhost:8000:
```powershell
cd ui; npm ci; npm run build; cd ..
```
If `ui\dist` does not exist the API still runs; UI pages return a JSON message telling you to build.

Developing the UI with hot reload (API must be running on :8000):
```powershell
cd ui; npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173, /api is proxied to :8000
npm run lint              # ESLint, zero warnings allowed
```
Pages: Dashboard, Clients & Deals (table, board, new client + deal with live assignment and
override), Deal detail, Rep profile, Heatmap (plus rule vs GDS similarity), Graph explorer.

## URLs
- API docs (Swagger): http://localhost:8000/docs
- Health: http://localhost:8000/api/health
- Neo4j Browser (dev): http://localhost:7474 (user `neo4j`, password from `api\.env`)

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8000/api/health | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
```

## Configuration
- `api/.env`: connection settings and secrets (see `api/.env.example`).
- `api/config.yaml`: business tunables (thresholds, weights, capacity, windows). Every key is
  required; an invalid value stops the API at startup with a message naming the key. Use a
  different file with the env var `APP_CONFIG_PATH`. View the loaded values at
  http://localhost:8000/api/meta/config.
- On every start the API applies `api/app/schema/init.cypher` (5 uniqueness constraints,
  6 range indexes, the 5 built-in Domain nodes). It is idempotent; `/api/health` shows `schema_ok`.

## How the forecast works
`GET /api/analytics/forecast` estimates how many clients each sales person will convert this
month. It looks at every open, owned deal expected to close this month. Each deal gets a win
probability: of the deals that reached the same stage in the last 12 months, the share that
were won, first using the rep's own deals in that domain, else the whole team's in that domain,
else the whole team's at that stage (at least 3 deals needed for the first two). A client
converts if at least one of its deals is won: P = 1 - (1 - p1)(1 - p2)... Clients at 70 % or more
count as "commit", 30 % or more as "best case". `/forecast/backtest` replays the same method on
last month as of its first day and compares it with what actually happened.

## How recommendations work
When a deal is created without an owner, the engine ranks every **available** sales person
(active, fewer open deals than capacity). Fit is the rep's own win rate in the deal's domain
(DIRECT, needs 3+ closed deals), or else the win rate of similar reps, discounted by 20 % (PEER;
"similar" = win rates within 10 points in 3+ shared domains), or, if nobody fits, overall win rate
(COLD_START; for domains with no history at all, RELATED comes first, see below).
Score = 70 % fit + 30 % availability. The top 5 are stored with a plain-language
reason and #1 becomes the owner; the manager can override. Expertise and similarity are rebuilt
nightly (02:00), after every seed, and on `POST /api/admin/recompute`.

## Adding domains
Besides the 5 built-ins, a manager can add a domain from the "New client and deal" drawer
(Domain → "+ New domain…") or with `POST /api/domains {name, description}`. The name and
description are turned into a vector by a small local embedding model
(`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` via fastembed; nothing leaves the machine), and its cosine similarity
to every other domain is stored on `RELATED_TO` edges. `GET /api/domains` lists them.

Nobody has history in a new domain, so DIRECT and PEER cannot apply. Reps are then ranked on
their **own** win rates in the up to 3 most similar domains above 0.65 similarity, weighted by
how far above 0.65 each one is, and discounted by 30 % (RELATED fit). Only if nobody has
related experience does COLD_START apply. Adding a domain also reruns the recompute, because
the rep-similarity score divides by the number of domains. Tunables: the `domains` group in
`config.yaml`. Seeding removes added domains.

- The model (~64 MB) is downloaded to `api\.models` the first time a domain is added (needs
  internet once; about 30–40 s). After that it loads from disk in a few seconds.
- It needs the **Microsoft Visual C++ 2015+ Redistributable (x64)**. With an outdated one,
  onnxruntime crashes the API on import:
  `winget install Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64`.
- If the model cannot be loaded, `POST /api/domains` returns 503 `EMBEDDINGS_UNAVAILABLE` and
  nothing is written; everything else keeps working.

## Analytics cross-check
With the API running against the dev database, recompute the main KPIs independently with
pandas and compare them with the API (exit code 0 = all match):
```powershell
cd api; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python scripts\crosscheck_kpis.py            # --api <url> to target another API
```

## Stop / reset
- Stop the API or Neo4j: press `Ctrl+C` in its terminal.
- Wipe the dev database (deletes all data): stop dev Neo4j, then
  `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\neo4j\dev\data\databases\neo4j, C:\neo4j\dev\data\transactions\neo4j`
  and start it again. The password is kept.
- Reset to the demo dataset (**wipes everything** in the dev database, no confirmation, no auth):
  ```powershell
  Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post http://localhost:8000/api/admin/seed | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
  ```
  Loads 15 sales people, ~366 clients, 695 deals and ~2.9k activities, deterministic for a
  given `AS_OF_DATE` and `seed.seed_random_seed`. Set `AS_OF_DATE=2026-10-06` in `api\.env`
  to get exactly the data the tests and demo numbers are based on.

## Running tests
Unit tests need no database. Integration tests need the **test** instance and are skipped
with a clear message if it is not running.
```powershell
# Terminal 3 - test Neo4j
C:\neo4j\test\bin\neo4j.bat console

# In api\ with the venv active
pytest -q
ruff check .; ruff format --check .
```

## Troubleshooting
- `Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded`: run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` once.
- `java` not found / Neo4j will not start: install Java 21 and open a new terminal.
- Port 7687/7474 (or 7688/7475) already in use: another Neo4j is running; stop it first.
- Health shows `apoc_version` or `gds_version` null: the jar is missing from `plugins\` or the
  `dbms.security.procedures.*` lines are missing; fix and restart that Neo4j instance.
